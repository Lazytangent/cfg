#+title: =cfg=

* Usage
** Installation
*** With =go= CLI directly from GitHub Repository
#+begin_src shell
go install github.com/lazytangent/cfg@HEAD
#+end_src

The =@HEAD= bit is necessary since I don't tag new updates very often.
*** From a cloned repo
#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/Lazytangent/cfg
  cd cfg
  go install .
#+end_src
* Notes
** Git code snippets
*** =status=
**** Updated but not yet committed
#+begin_src bash
❯ config status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   alacritty.yml

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
#+end_src

In the terminal, the =modified= file line is red.

**** Staged files but not yet committed
#+begin_src bash
❯ config status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   alacritty.yml
	new file:   keybinds.yml

Untracked files not listed (use -u option to show untracked files)
#+end_src

In the terminal, the =modified= and =new file= lines are green.

**** Newly committed but not yet pushed
#+begin_src bash
❯ config status
On branch main
nothing to commit (use -u to show untracked files)
#+end_src

There seems to be some variance in the output for this.

No color for this version.
